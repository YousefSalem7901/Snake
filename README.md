## About
I was inspired by the original snake game. This game pins two players against each other as snakes to see who eats the most bugs. I made a snake character by storing array which index correspond to its size and tracked it's moments and increased its size based on the amount of bugs consumed. Building the game from scratch and having to figure out how to render a moving object in pygame was difficult.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Getting both snakes to accept to move independent of each other at the same time

What I learned
Games are the most complicated and time consuming projects

What's next for MultiPlayerSnake
SPEED BOOOOOST!!!
