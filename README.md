# Snake
Multiplayer snake game

Inspiration
I was inspired by the original snake game

What it does
pins two players against each other as snakes to see who eats the most bugs.

How I built it
Made a snake character by storing array which index correspond to its size and tracked it's moments and increased its size based on the amount of bugs consumed

Challenges I ran into
Building the game from scratch and having to figure out how to render a moving object.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Getting both snakes to accept to move independent of each other at the same time

What I learned
Games are the most complicated and time consuming projects

What's next for MultiPlayerSnake
SPEED BOOOOOST!!!
